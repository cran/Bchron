# Bchron 4.3

Added some new functions:

  - dateInfluence, which works out how influential a single date is in a core
  - coreInfluence, which tries to estimate the total uncertainty reduction/increase between two Bchronology runs
  - choosePositions, which suggest new positions/depths to date to maximally reduce uncertainty
